# JavaScript Local Storage and Event Delegation

---

## Challenge 30 is a series of coding challenges created by Wes Bos. In one of the challenges, he focuses on building a project using JavaScript, local storage, and event delegation.

The project involves creating a web page that allows users to add and remove items from a to-do list. The items are stored in the browser's local storage, which allows the list to persist even if the user navigates away from the page or closes the browser.

To implement this functionality, the project uses event delegation, a technique that involves attaching event listeners to a parent element and then handling events that occur on its child elements. This allows the project to handle dynamic content, such as items added to the to-do list, without needing to attach event listeners to each individual item.

Overall, the project provides a good opportunity to practice working with JavaScript, local storage, and event delegation. It also showcases how these technologies can be used together to create a useful and interactive web application.
